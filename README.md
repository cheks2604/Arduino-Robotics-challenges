# Arduino-Robotics-challenges
These were challenges or rather tasks I made an Arduino with a 2 servos attached to it to accomplish. 
## Overview
A series of robotics challenges completed using Arduino and C++. The projects focused on autonomous navigation, pattern execution, and light-based movement control, simulating real-world robotics fundamentals.

## Features
Challenge 2- Programmed a robot to navigate a **Figure-8 path (2+ ft)** and return to the start point with precision.  
Challenge 4- Designed a **custom navigation pattern** with multiple direction changes.  
Challenge 3- Integrated **blinking LED indicators** to signal task completion.  
Challege 5- Built a **light-responsive vehicle** using a photoresistor:
  - Forward motion in ambient light
  - Spin movement in dim light
  - Reverse motion in darkness

## Technologies Used
- Arduino Uno  
- C++  
- Photoresistor sensor  
- LEDs
- Switches


## How It Works
The robots relied on sensor input (photoresistors in challenge 5) to adjust motor behavior in real time. Navigation logic was implemented in C++ and tested in multiple indoor lighting conditions.
## Future Improvements
- Add obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensors  
- Implement PID control for smoother navigation 
## Demo
Note not all demo vidoes are here but the arduino physical build was the same through the entire challenge.
